# jscoinflip
"JS Coinflip" is a very simple JavaScript script that simulates the flipping of a coin with two outcomes of probabilities 0.5 each: "heads", and "tails".

To run the script, you must have a JS-compatible browser or node.js installed.

Alternatively, you can head on to http://js.do/code/jscoinflip and run a version of the program there.
